# üìä IBM Data Analyst Professional Certificate Projects

Welcome to my project repository for the **IBM Data Analyst Professional Certificate**. Although I audited this course without a paid certificate, I completed all hands-on labs and final projects to gain practical experience with real-world data analysis tools and workflows.

This repository highlights my journey through data cleaning, visualization, SQL querying, dashboard development, and storytelling using industry-standard tools such as Excel, Python, SQL, and BI dashboards.
